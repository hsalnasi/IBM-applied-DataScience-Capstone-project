 # Executive summary  
 This capstone project aims to predict the successful landing of the SpaceX Falcon 9 first stage using various machine learning classification algorithms. The project involves several key steps:
 * Data collection, wrangling, and formatting
 * Exploratory data analysis
 * Interactive data visualization
 * Machine learning prediction
 
 According to your graphs, there is a correlation between certain features of rocket launches and their outcomes, whether successful or not. Additionally, it appears that the decision tree algorithm may be the most effective in predicting the successful landing of the Falcon 9 first stage.
 
 # Introduction  
 The goal of this capstone project is to predict whether the Falcon 9 first stage will land successfully. SpaceX offers Falcon 9 rocket launches at a cost of 62 million dollars, as advertised on their website. This is significantly lower than other providers, who charge upwards of 165 million dollars per launch. The cost savings are largely due to SpaceXâ€™s ability to reuse the first stage. By predicting whether the first stage will land successfully, we can determine the cost of a launch. This information could be useful for other companies looking to compete with SpaceX for rocket launches.

It is important to note that most unsuccessful landings are planned. SpaceX sometimes performs controlled landings in the ocean. The main question we aim to answer is whether the first stage of a Falcon 9 rocket will land successfully given a set of features about the launch, such as payload mass, orbit type, and launch site.
# Methodology  
The methodology includes: 
* Data collection, wrangling, and formatting, using:
  * SpaceX API
  * Web scraping
  
* Exploratory data analysis (EDA), using:
  * Pandas and NumPy
  * SQL
  
* Data visualization, using:
  * Matplotlib and Seaborn
  * Folium
  * Dash
* Machine learning prediction, using :
  * Logistic regression
  * Support vector machine (SVM)
  * Decision tree
  * K-nearest neighbors (KNN)
